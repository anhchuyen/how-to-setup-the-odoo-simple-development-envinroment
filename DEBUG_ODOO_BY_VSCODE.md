# How to Debug Odoo by VSCode

#### Please read this
- Before you read the following sections, you need a Ubuntu machine (real or virtual machine, it's up to you)
  - You can use any OS to do. But in this guide, I use the Ubuntu
- To use the VSCode to run or debug the Odoo, you need to know some things:
  - Odoo needs a environment to run -> We will use the virtual environment in [this guide](https://github.com/tuantrantg/how-to-setup-the-odoo-simple-development-envinroment/blob/master/README.md) to run Odoo by the VSCode
  - Odoo also needs a PostgreSQL server, please "google" to setup a PostgreSQL server if you don't have it on your machine
  - VSCode must be installed on your machine & you must install the ***Python (ms-python.python)*** package

#### Prepare the debug configuration
